      "content": "Create the core visual PipelineTimeline component and its CSS in apps/desktop/src/components/detail/. The component renders a horizontal stepper showing 6 pipeline stages (GET → REVIEW → PLAN → AUDIT → EXECUTE → SHIP). Each step has a circular indicator, label, and status. Steps before current = completed (green checkmark), current step = active (pulsing blue dot), steps after = pending (dimmed). Connector lines between steps show progress (solid green if completed, dimmed if pending). Show total elapsed time using createdAt timestamp with a live-updating 1s interval timer. Support both light and dark themes using existing CSS variables. Follow existing animation patterns from WorkProgressCard.css (pulse-segment keyframe).",

Extend types to support optional pipelineHistory array for per-step timing: add PipelineStepRecord to WorkCard.tsx IssueContext, packages/shared/src/types/state.ts IssueWork, and apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/state.rs IssueContext struct. The pipelineHistory field is optional for backward compatibility. Update WorkContext interface in IssueDetail.tsx to include createdAt, lastActivity, and pipelineHistory fields.",

Track previous step via useRef to trigger animations on step change. Add useEffect with 1s setInterval for live elapsed time updates on active step and total time. Polish visual presentation: ensure clean layout at various panel widths, proper spacing, readable labels, and consistent appearance in both light and dark themes.",
