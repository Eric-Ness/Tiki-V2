Build verified successful.",
      "content": "Update the `.resize-handle` CSS in layout.css to implement:\n\n1. **Base state**: Make handles more subtle/transparent (currently rgba 0.1, should be near-transparent)\n\n2. **Hover state**: Add a grip indicator using CSS pseudo-elements (::before) to show vertical dots or lines that indicate draggability. Keep the subtle blue background.\n\n3. **Active/dragging state**: Use the `[data-resize-handle-active]` attribute selector that react-resizable-panels provides to style the active dragging state with the full accent color #60a5fa.\n\n4. **Transitions**: Ensure smooth transitions for background, opacity, and any transform properties.\n\nThe grip indicator pattern should use 3 small dots or lines vertically centered in the handle.",
