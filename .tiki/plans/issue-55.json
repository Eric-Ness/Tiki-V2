Excludes if in completedIssueNumbers\n2. Then checks activeWork\n\nThe fix:\n1. Check activeWork first\n2. If activeWork exists with non-completed status, use that for column placement\n3. Only fall back to completed exclusion if no active work exists\n\nSpecifically, change the filter to:\n- If issue has activeWork with status != 'completed', use statusToColumn to place it\n- Only exclude from non-completed columns if issue has NO activeWork entry",
