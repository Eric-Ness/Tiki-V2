Issues only appear (or fail to appear) when explicitly fetched.\n\n**Desired behavior:** Display a status indicator in the UI that shows:\n- Connection status (connected/disconnected/error)\n- Currently configured repository (owner/repo)\n- Authentication state (authenticated/unauthenticated)\n\n**Implementation notes:**\n- Add a status component to the sidebar or header area\n- Use the existing `gh` CLI integration to check authentication status\n- Poll or check status on app startup and periodically thereafter\n- Show actionable error messages when connection fails (e.g., \"Run `gh auth login` to authenticate\")",
